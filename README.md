Features

Convert: Transforms a string like "hello" into a phonetic representation like "huh euh luh luh oh".

Reverse: Converts the phonetic string back to the original text.

Copy: A convenient "Copy to Clipboard" button for quick use.

Install the Flask library, which powers the web interface:

    pip install Flask

How to Run
